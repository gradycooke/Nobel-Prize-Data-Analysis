# Nobel Prize Data Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project based on a dataset of Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2023. Using Python and libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, the notebook investigates historical trends in Nobel Prize awards across gender, nationality, and category.

## Key Analysis Areas
- Most common gender and birth country among laureates
- Decade-wise analysis of U.S.-born winners
- Trends in female representation by decade and category
- Identification of laureates who have won multiple Nobel Prizes
- Timeline of notable milestones, including the first female laureate

## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Goal
To analyze and visualize Nobel Prize data to uncover patterns in award distributions, demographic representation, and historical achievements.
